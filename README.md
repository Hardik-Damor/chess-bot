# chess-bot

A C++ project in which you can play chess against an AI with a specified decision tree depth that uses alpha-beta pruning algorithm to predict the optimal move. Aside from basic moves, this mini chess engine also implements chess rules such as castling, en passant, fifty-move rule, threefold repetition, and pawn promotion.
